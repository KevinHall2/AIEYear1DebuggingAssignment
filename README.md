# AIE Year1 Samples

The **RaylibStarterCpp.zip** contains a project already set up to use Raylib with all libraries and includes in place.

It does **not** include GLM or any other convenience libraries, you will need to add those yourself if you want to use them.

This program reads from and writes out information from a binary file that is included in the download of this .zip file. The file is only loaded once, and the Left and Right arrow keys can be used to iterate through the different pages of information stored within the 
binary data file. The Escape key can also be used to close the program instead of having to click out of the window. To gain access to the program, download the .zip file found at https://github.com/KevinHall2/AIEYear1DebuggingAssignment/releases and extract its contents
to a folder of your choice. Then open the .exe file to run the program.
